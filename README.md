Python script to find, fetch and add album name and album cover based on Artist/Title

This Python script helps you find, fetch, and add album names and album covers to your music files based on the artist and title. It uses the Spotify API, so you will need to [create a Spotify account and obtain an API key](https://developer.spotify.com). 

Once you have your API key, point the script to the folder containing your music files. The script will then automatically update your music files with the correct album information and cover art.
